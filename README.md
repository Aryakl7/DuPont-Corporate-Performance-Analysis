# 📊 Financial Performance & DuPont Analysis of Global Corporations

### 🎯 Project Objective
This project deconstructs the Return on Equity (ROE) for 10 multinational corporations using the DuPont Identity framework. The primary goal is to move beyond the surface-level ROE figure to isolate the core drivers of shareholder return: **operational efficiency**, **asset utilization**, and **financial leverage**. The analysis culminates in a specific, data-driven strategic recommendation for Walmart to enhance its net margin.

**🛠️ Tools:** Microsoft Excel

### ⚙️ Methodology

The core of this analysis is the 3-step DuPont model, which breaks down ROE as follows:

**ROE = (Net Profit Margin) x (Asset Turnover) x (Equity Multiplier)**

1.  **📄 Data Collection:** Financial data (Net Income, Revenue, Total Assets, Total Equity) was synthesized from the most recent annual reports of 10 diverse, publicly traded multinational corporations, including Apple, Toyota, and Walmart.
2.  **🏗️ Model Engineering:** An interactive financial model was built in MS Excel to perform the DuPont calculations for each company, allowing for dynamic comparison.
3.  **💡 Strategic Analysis:** The model's outputs were used to identify relative strengths and weaknesses. A deep dive was conducted on Walmart, leveraging data visualizations to formulate a strategic case for improving shareholder value by focusing on net margin enhancement.

### ✨ Key Features & Analysis

#### 1. Interactive DuPont Model (in `DuPont_Analysis_Model.xlsx`)
The Excel model allows for a clear, side-by-side comparison of what drives ROE for each of the 10 selected corporations. It clearly isolates whether a company's high ROE is due to high margins (like a luxury brand), high turnover (like a retailer), or high leverage.

#### 2. 🔍 Strategic Case Study: Walmart
The analysis identified Walmart's low net margin as a key area for improvement. A stacked column chart visualization was created to effectively communicate how even a marginal increase in its 2.39% net margin could significantly impact its ROE, given its massive asset base.
